About Me
Hi, I'm Vitor Ibraim! I'm 20 years old, from Brazil, and currently working as a Software Development Intern. I’m a self-taught learner with a passion for physics and mathematics, which fuels my drive to solve complex problems and build innovative solutions.

In my role, I initially developed and implemented automated tests to streamline the company’s workflow, using Cypress and Jenkins. Later, I transitioned to development, where I built two complete applications from backend to frontend. Currently, I’m exploring RabbitMQ and Docker to enhance our system’s capabilities and workflow.

Skills and Tools
Languages & Frameworks: JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, PostgreSQL, Angular, React, Vue.js, Python, jQuery
Automation & CI/CD: Cypress, Selenium, Jenkins
Containerization: Docker
Other: Unit Testing, RabbitMQ (in progress)
