ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸš€

I'm a passionate Brazilian developer currently working as a trainee at a Fintech company. My coding journey spans across various languages and technologies, including C#, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Groovy, and good ol' C.

In my role, I've gained hands-on experience in building robust software solutions and automation tools. I'm particularly adept at crafting automated tests using Selenium and NUnit, ensuring the quality and reliability of our applications.

One of my proud achievements is a solo project I developed for my company, demonstrating my ability to deliver innovative solutions independently.

I'm well-versed in version control systems like GitLab and have a knack for managing repositories efficiently. I've also been delving into the world of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, honing my skills in Jenkins and exploring ways to streamline our development processes.

Here on GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from personal experiments to contributions to open-source initiatives. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out for collaboration opportunities. Let's code something amazing together! ðŸ’»âœ¨
